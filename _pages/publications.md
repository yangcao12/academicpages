### The Spillover Effect of Waiver Disclosures on Corporate Risk-Taking
Job Market Paper

I examine the impact of covenant waiver disclosures by peer firms on the risk-taking behaviors of focal firms who share lenders. I posit that waiver disclosures by peer firms diminish the perceived uncertainty and expected costs associated with covenant violations, thereby diminishing the precautionary stance of management and encouraging increased risk-taking. Employing a natural language processing machine learning model to identify covenant violations and waiver disclosures in SEC filings, I conduct a determinant analysis which reveals that borrower characteristics (ROA, leverage, and PP&E) and loan features (lender’s share) correlate with the likelihood of receiving a waiver, albeit with limited explanatory power overall. For my identification strategy, I employ different-in-differences and an instrumental variable to isolate variations in waiver disclosures that are exogenous to and independent of focal firms’ risk-taking. I predict and find that, following the peer waiver disclosures, focal firms amplify their risk-taking, as indicated by higher stock return volatility. Examining the underlying mechanisms, focal firms increase risk-taking by increasing leverage and product-development efforts. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that the effects are more pronounced in cases where a waiver is unconditional and focal firms lack relationship lending. Overall, these findings illuminate a spillover effect where waiver disclosures by peer firms significantly influence managers' capital structure and investment decisions.

### Is Information Production for the U.S. Stock Market Becoming More Concentrated? (with Miao Liu and Rachel Xi Zhang)
Over the past two decades, the US stock market has undergone significant changes in its structure, with small firms disappearing and large firms gaining market share. This study investigates whether the dominance of large firms in the market creates positive spillover for or shifts resources away from small firms' information production. Using a shift-share IV approach complemented with a difference-indifferences design, our identification strategy isolates two independent variations in large firms’ market share that are plausibly exogenous to small firms’ fundamentals. We find that as large firms gain market share, information production resources, including the attention of financial analysts and institutional investors, are shifted away from small firms, even if the size and business fundamentals of small firms remain unchanged. The loss of information production reduces stock price informativeness. The evidence points to an increasing market concentration that not only favors large firms but also leads to a skewed distribution of information production resources, thereby worsening the information environment for small firms.
