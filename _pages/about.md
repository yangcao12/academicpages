I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Accounting at the Carroll School of Management, Boston College. My research interests lie in producing and utilizing financial information in capital markets. Specifically, my current research examines 1) the real effects of accounting disclosure; 2) the impact of AI/Machine learning on corporate disclosure.
