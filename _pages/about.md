<div style="text-align: justify">I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Accounting at the Carroll School of Management, Boston College. My research interests lie in the production and consequences of financial disclosure, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in financial markets, and the economic impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors and their associated risks.</div>&nbsp;
<div style="text-align: justify">In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for table tennis and represent Boston College in various tournaments. I serve as the Vice President Education in the <a href="https://tott.us/meetourmembers.html">Talk of the Town Toastmasters</a> club, where I contribute to the development of members' communication and leadership skills.</div>
