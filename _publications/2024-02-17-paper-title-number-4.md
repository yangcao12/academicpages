title: "The Spillover Effect of Waiver Disclosures on Corporate Risk-Taking"
excerpt: "I examine the impact of covenant waiver disclosures by peer firms on the risk-taking behaviors of focal firms who share lenders. I posit that waiver disclosures by peer firms diminish the perceived uncertainty and expected costs associated with covenant violations, thereby diminishing the precautionary stance of management and encouraging increased risk-taking. Employing a natural language processing machine learning model to identify covenant violations and waiver disclosures in SEC filings, I conduct a determinant analysis which reveals that borrower characteristics (ROA, leverage, and PP&E) and loan features (lender’s share) correlate with the likelihood of receiving a waiver, albeit with limited explanatory power overall. For my identification strategy, I employ different-in-differences and an instrumental variable to isolate variations in waiver disclosures that are exogenous to and independent of focal firms’ risk-taking. I predict and find that, following the peer waiver disclosures, focal firms amplify their risk-taking, as indicated by higher stock return volatility. Examining the underlying mechanisms, focal firms increase risk-taking by increasing leverage and product-development efforts. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that the effects are more pronounced in cases where a waiver is unconditional and focal firms lack relationship lending. Overall, these findings illuminate a spillover effect where waiver disclosures by peer firms significantly influence managers' capital structure and investment decisions."
